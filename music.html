		<h2>Shir Appeal</h2>

			<p>I joined <a href="http://www.shirappeal.com/">Shir Appeal</a> 
			(Tufts' Only Coed Jewish A Cappella group) last year 
			and am now the Music Director of the group. All the music we sing has some
			kind of Jewish significance; we don't just sing in Hebrew, but also in English, 
			Ladino, Yemenite Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, and Yiddish. I love spending 
			time making music with the people in this group. As a music nerd, I must say
			making harmony is simply one of the most beautiful things in life. </p>

			<p>As Music Director, I lead every rehearsal (which is seven hours per week)
			with warmups and song-learning. I run the audition and callback process twice a
			year. After organizing the song selection process, I arrange music for the group
			and mangage the recording process. I just produced our most recent album "Perspective"
			with Plaid Productions. You can now hear us on 
			<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/30MNgU2Qs9zUNrNYtbN2g4">Spotify</a>!</p>

			<p>Check out the song I arranged this past semester in Ladino called "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Zw1ZONhUs">Yo M'enamori</a>" 
			originally performed by Casata Deleon. And I also got to sing a fun duet 
			about healing with my friend Sarah in "<a href="">Ana El Na</a>". 
			</p>

		<h2>Piano</h2>

			<p>I have been classically trained on the piano since I was five years-old. 
			Some of my favorite pieces to play include: </p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Arabesque No. 1 by Debussy</li>
				<li>Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.12 in A-flat major</li>
				<li>Milonga del Angel by Astor Piazzolla</li>
				<li>Six Morceaux Op. 11 - Waltz by Rachmaninoff</li>
				<li>Arabesque by Schumann(and really anything by Schumann)</li>
				<li>Rondo alla Turca by Mozart</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Some favorites!</h2>
	
		<p>Here is my favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ">song</a>. 
                I love the different sections and how the song takes the listener on a journey.</p>
	
		<p>My favorite artists include David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Sara Bareilles, and Alicia Keyes. 
		Some of my favorite bands are Spoon, Lake Street Dive, Glass Animals, Supertramp, Queen, and 
		Genesis. As a kid who performed in many musical productions, I am also a sucker for Broadway 
		soundtracks like Next to Normal, Spring Awakening, Rent, Into the Woods, Waitress, and 
		Hamilton.</p>
