		<h2>Shir Appeal</h2>

			<p>I joined <a href="http://www.shirappeal.com/">Shir Appeal</a> 
			(Tufts' Only Coed Jewish A Cappella group - believe it or not!) 
			my first year at Tufts and led as Music Director last year.
			This job included leading every rehearsal at seven hours per week,
			running the audition/callback process both semesters, arranging
			music for the group, and finally producing our most recent album, 
			"<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/30MNgU2Qs9zUNrNYtbN2g4">Perspective</a>"!</p>
			
			<p>All of the music we sing has some kind of Jewish significance; we
			sing in many languages including English, Ladino, Yemenite Arabic, Portuguese, 
			Russian, and Yiddish. I love spending time every week making music with 
			this lovely group of people. As a music nerd, I must say that making harmony is simply 
			one of the more beautiful things in life. </p>

			<p>Check out the song I arranged and solo-ed in this past semester:
			"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqzld3FkYQk">Like the Dawn</a>". 
			Last year I arranged a song in Ladino called "<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Zw1ZONhUs">Yo M'enamori</a>" 
			originally performed by Casata Deleon. And I also got to sing a fun duet 
			about healing with my friend Sarah in 
			"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG6xYDG0Txs">Ana El Na</a>".
			</p>

		<h2>Piano</h2>

			<p>I have been classically trained on the piano since I was five years-old. 
			Some of my favorite pieces to play include: </p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Arabesque No. 1 by Debussy</li>
				<li>Beethoven's Piano Sonata No.12 in A-flat major</li>
				<li>Milonga del Angel by Astor Piazzolla</li>
				<li>Six Morceaux Op. 11 - Waltz by Rachmaninoff</li>
				<li>Arabesque by Schumann(and really anything by Schumann)</li>
				<li>Rondo alla Turca by Mozart</li>
			</ul>

			<p>More recently, I switched over to jazz piano and have picked up
			a bunch of beautiful songs:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Smile</li>
				<li>Sometime Ago</li>
				<li>Misty</li>
				<li>I Got It Bad</li>
				<li>How High the Moon</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Some favorites!</h2>
	
		<p>Here is my favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ">song</a>. 
                I love the different sections and how the song takes the listener on a journey.</p>
	
		<p>My favorite artists include David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Sara Bareilles, and Alicia Keyes. 
		Some of my favorite bands are Twenty-One Pilots, Lake Street Dive, Supertramp, and 
		Genesis. As a kid who performed in many musical productions, I am also a sucker for Broadway 
		soundtracks like Next to Normal, Spring Awakening, Rent, Into the Woods, Waitress, and 
		Hamilton.</p>
