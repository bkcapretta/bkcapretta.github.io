                <div class="info">
                        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                        <p>I am a Sophomore at Tufts University from Mill Valley, CA and I love
                        to make things and learn.  </p>

                        <h3>What am I studying?</h3>
                        <p>I am a Computer Science and Cognitive & Brain Sciences (CBS)
                        major with a Music minor. CBS is an interdisciplinary major
                        including Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science. It is a
                        large range of interests, I know, but I love it all.</p>

                        <h3>What is my coding background?</h3>
                        <p>I started learning Java my Junior year of high school. Now in college,
                        I have been learning C++, Javascript, Python, and HTML. I love the problem-solving
                         aspect of computer science. I do not like to just sit down and code.
                        I take a step back and like to plan, draw pictures, and ask lots of questions.
                        See more about my interesting projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>

                        <h3>What are some of my hobbies?</h3>
                        <p>I LOVE to sing and play piano. I am currently Music Director of my
                        a cappella group <a href="http://www.shirappeal.com/">Shir Appeal</a>.
                        I've been playing piano since I was five. I'm classically trained
                        and have the SAME birthday as Mozart. Is it a sign?
                        <a href="music.html">Maybe.</a> </p>

                        <h3>What else do I like to do with my time?</h3>

                        <h3>I appreciate puns and jokes very much.</h3>
