        <hr/>
                
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I am a Junior at Tufts University from Mill Valley, CA and I love
            to make things and learn.  </p>

            <h3>What am I studying?</h3>
            <p>I am a Computer Science and Cognitive & Brain Sciences (CBS)
            major with a Music minor. CBS is an interdisciplinary major
            including Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science. It is a
            large range of interests, I know, but I love it all.</p>

            <h3>What is my coding background?</h3>
            <p>I started learning Java my Junior year of high school. Now in college,
            I have been exposed to C++, C, Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, Impcore and
            more. Since the intro class of course, I have taken Data Structures, Discrete
            Mathematics, Web Programming, Machine Structure & Assembly Language
            and now Programming Languages.</p>

            <p>I love the problem-solving aspect of computer science. 
            I don't think doing computer science means just sitting down and staring at
            a screen all day. I like taking a step back from a project by planning on 
            paper, drawing pictures, and asking lots of questions.
            See more about my interesting projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>What are some of my hobbies?</h3>
            <p>I LOVE to sing and play piano. Last year I served as Music Director of my
            a cappella group <a href="http://www.shirappeal.com/">Shir Appeal</a>.
            I've been playing classical piano since I was five, but now play jazz
            on the keys. I have the SAME birthday as Mozart - is it a sign?
            <a href="music.html">Maybe.</a> </p>

            <h3>What else do I like to do with my time?</h3>
            <ul><p>
                    <li>Run a <a href="music.html#radio">radio show</a></li>
                    <li>Lead data structure labs every week!</li>
                    <li><a href="other.html#film">Film</a></li>
                    <li><a href="other.html#w1b">Non-profit work</a></li>
                    <li>Playing tennis and hiking</li>
            </p></ul>

            <h3>I appreciate puns and jokes very much.</h3>
            <p>How does a moon get its hair cut?</p>
            <p>Eclipse it.</p>
