                <h2>I like to make and learn.</h2>

                <div class="info">
                        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                        <p>I am a Sophomore at Tufts University in Boston. I am from Mill
                           Valley, a town just North of San Francisco. Don't worry, I can
                           handle the cold really well (at least so far). </p>

                        <h3>What am I studying?</h3>
                        <p>I am a Computer Science and Cognitive & Brain Sciences (CBS)
                           major with a Music minor. CBS is an interdisciplinary major
                           including Psychology, Philosophy, and Computer Science. It is a
                           large range of interests, I know, but I love it all.</p>

                        <h3>What is my coding background?</h3>
                        <p>I started learning Java my Junior year of high school. Now in college,
                           I have been learning C++, Javascript, Python, and HTML. More about my
                           <a href="projects.html">projects</a> here.</p>

                        <h3>How much do I like music?</h3>
                        <p>I LOVE to sing and play piano. I am Catholic in a Jewish
                           a cappella group called <a href="www.shirappeal.com">Shir Appeal</a>.
                           Weird, I know. I've been playing piano since I was five.
                           I'm classically trained and have the SAME birthday as Mozart. Is
                           it a sign? <a href="music.html">Maybe.</a> </p>

                        <h3>What else do I do with my time?</h3>
                        <ul><p>
                                <li>Film</li>
                                <li>Radio Show</li>

                        </p></ul>

                        <h3>I appreciate puns and jokes very much</h3>
                        <p>What's the difference between snowmen and snowwomen?</p>
                        <p>Snowballs.</p>
