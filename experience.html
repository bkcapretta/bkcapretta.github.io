          <h2 class="section-heading">Spotify | Backend Engineer</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2019 to Current - Boston, MA</h3>
          
          <p>After using Spotify for the first time in 2016 to listen to Hamilton's soundtrack, it immediately became 
            my dream one day to work here. Everything I did in college was in pursuit to help my chances of landing that Spotify
            internship... Fast forward four years and I feel like I have the coolest job in the world.</p>
          
          <p>Currently as a full-time Backend Engineer at Spotify, I am working on implementing the data-facing 
            backend service for the 2020 Wrapped Campaign (your top songs, artists, genres, etc). Prior to embedding on this team, I worked on a squad
            focused around playlist curation for any mood or activity. I stepped up as the Road Manager for a test surrounding
            a new playlist concept: "Seed Mix". Our Seed Mix test involved creating new mixes for users upon completing Taste Onboarding, 
            and comparing it side by side with Daily Mixes. </p>
            
          <p>Prior to that project, I implemented the playlist logic for a test called, "Suggest to Create", 
            which gave users a shelf of moods (Chill, Party, Workout, etc) to choose from to create new playlists.
            Aside from that, I helped my team migrate radio and playlist frameworks to new experimentation platforms and upgrade our pipelines.
            Outside of the work day to day, I lead the Boston office as a Women@ ERG Co-Lead and help coordinate weekly social presentations
            for co-workers to share their passions (from topics like Frisbee and A cappella to Emotional Robots and Poetry).
          </p>

          <p>As a backend intern at Spotify during the summer of 2019, I joined a team working on playlists catered to user identities, 
          such as Daily Mix. My summer project involved iterating upon a hack-week project consisting of two 
          new playlist ideas: On Repeat & Repeat Rewind (mixes that would show you the music you can't stop listening to).
          I implemented new features, improved code quality, added unit and integration tests, fixed bugs in Java, and 
          generally made it ready for production. Collaborating with Project and Data Curation, I made sure the
          playlists' heuristics matched the expected listening behavior. Finally, I setup an experiment with varying test cells
          on 6% of Spotify users, which led to an increase in user consumption. </p>
          
          <p></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">JumboCode | Project Manager</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Fall 2018 & Spring 2019 - Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>I served as a Project Manager in <a href=“https://www.facebook.com/JumboCode/”>JumboCode</a>,
          which is a student-run club dedicated to making websites and applications
          for non-profits while empowering students to work on out-of-school projects.
          I led a project to make a website for the <a href="https://youtu.be/fk-BdViAczU">Textbook Exchange
          Network</a> (TEN). TEN is a coalition of student-run textbook exchanges
          on Boston university campuses where students can browse, buy, and sell
          used books every semester. </p>

          <p>Found in 2016, TEN originally created their own version using
          Google Forms and Google Spreadsheets, but their implementation wasn’t
          secure nor scalable enough, especially when it came to expanding beyond just Tufts University.
          My JumboCode team of eight developers and two designers implemented a secure and scalable website
          and database to manage the buying and selling of books. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/TENPoster.png" alt="">

          <p>Filling this leadership position forced me to consider every part of
          the project from ground-up, like constructing a project plan,
          making a design doc, reflecting weekly on failures and successes, running hallway
          usability testing, running UI/UX testing, considering defects and vulnerabilities,
          and more.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">LinkedIn | Software Engineer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2018 - San Francisco, CA</h3>

          <p>I interned within LinkedIn Marketing Solutions (LMS),
          specifically on its Campaign Manager which handles
          ad accounts for companies. My first project for the summer focused on associating
          one's company with the ad account when going through the new campaign creation
          flow. With the API already finished, I jumped in by writing a design document
          and implemented the front-end component. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/linkedin.png" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cm-basecamp.jpg" alt="">

          <p>The second half of the internship focused on Company Creation. A user must
          associate a company page in the campaign creation flow, but if they
          have no existing company page, they need to create one on the spot.
          The original version redirected users to a new window to create this
          company page; however, it was found that 20% fewer users finished the campaign
          creation flow when having to create a company page. The new Company Creation
          design featured inline efforts to mitigate the attrition of transitioning to a new window. 
          My contributions included implementing the API and designing the front-end.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft | Explorer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2017 - Redmond, WA</h3>

          <p>I interned in the Explorer Program which gave me the opportunity to
          "explore" both the Program Manager position and the Software Developer
          role. I really enjoyed the creative aspect of being a PM and the
          problem-solving challenge of being a dev.</p>

          <p>I worked on a team called Microsoft Sway which is part of the Office
          Suite. After picking a template and inputting desired text/pictures,
          Sway does all the design and layout for the user, creating a beautiful
          presentation or document immediately.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/msbuilding.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/msteam.jpg" alt="">

          <p>I was grouped with two other interns and we were tasked with improving
          the discoverability of the navigation feature (also known as the Table of
          Contents). If someone wanted to get through a long Sway, it was our job
          to make the Table of Contents easier to see and use. The first four weeks
          were spent as Program Managers designing to make the navigation
          feature more discoverable. This time included a lot of talking to designers,
          presenting ideas, adjusting to fit what the users wanted, etc. The last
          eight weeks were spent developing the project in Typescript and C#.</p>

          <p>We implemented the functionality for the pull-down button at the top
          of the left photo and the Table of Contents bar at the top of the screen
          on the right photo.</p>

          <p>For the entirety of 2017, I was a lab leader for multiple computer
          laboratories each week for intermediate programming students in Data Structures.
          After meeting with other lab leaders once a week, I graded homework and
          provided individual assistance with class homework and projects during
          office hours.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2016 | Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>Two summers ago I worked at the <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">
          Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a>
          (CEEO) where I learned about:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Arduinos</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pis</li>
            <li>GrovePi (<a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/" target="_blank">Dexter Industries</a>)</li>
            <li>Wifi and Bluetooth</li>
            <li>Internet of Things</li>
            <li>If-This-Then-That model</li>
            <li>Javacript and Python</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For my first project of the summer, I was tasked with making an inventory
          system for the lab. I used Google Spreadsheet's powerful tool, the Script
          Editor, to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and
          learned that Google has some neat built-in functions.</p>

          <p>Here is a look at the interface. See more about it
          <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Inventory-System" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>

          <center><img class="img-fluid" src="img/inventory.png" alt=""></center>

          <p>Later on in the summer, I worked with the GrovePi (while my partner
          worked with the EV3) and the idea of the Internet of Things. The purpose
          was to take physical inputs to produce virtual outputs with the devices,
          and vice versa. One example I created posted tweets when a button was
          pressed on the GrovePi. Another small project I worked livestreamed all
          the current tweets and a light sensor would flash when a specific hashtag
          appeared. </p>
