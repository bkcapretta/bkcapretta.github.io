          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2019 to Current - New York City, NY</h3>
          
          <p>For the past year, I have been working on implementing the new <b>"Enhance"</b> feature inside of user playlists which surfaces recommendations based on the very tracks in your playlist. Feeling like you want to mix things up in a stale playlist or find new recs similar to your playlist intent? Hit that "Enhance" button! I've been working closely on improving the recommendation quality of our recs and delivering the new interactivity feature. </p>

          <p>Last year I worked on the data-facing 
            backend service for the <b>2020 Wrapped Campaign</b> (your top songs, artists, genres, etc). Prior to that, I worked on a squad focused around playlist curation for any mood or activity. I road managed a test, implemented playlist strategies, and helped migrate radio and playlist frameworks to new experimentation platforms and upgrade our pipelines. </p>

            <p>As an intern, I fleshed out a hack week project to production-ready code, in which we tested, <b>On Repeat & Repeat Rewind</b> (mixes that would show you the music you can't stop listening to). This test led to an increase in Spotify overall consumption, which is no simple feat. </p>
            
          <p>
            Outside of my team, I lead the <b>Incident Management</b> workstream in my mission, facilitating post-mortems and generally triaging incidents. I also lead the product area's tech strategy to increase <b>mentorship</b> across the PA.
          </p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Fall 2018 & Spring 2019 - Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>I served as a Project Manager in <a href=“https://www.facebook.com/JumboCode/”>JumboCode</a>,
          which is a Tufts student-run club dedicated to making websites and applications
          for non-profits while empowering students to work on out-of-school projects.
          I led a project to make a website for the <b><a href="https://www.textbookexchangenetwork.com/">Textbook Exchange
          Network</a> (TEN)</b>, a coalition of student-run textbook exchanges on Boston university campuses where students can browse, buy, and sell used books every semester. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">LinkedIn | Software Engineer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2018 - San Francisco, CA</h3>

          <p>Intering within LinkedIn Marketing Solutions (LMS), I focused on its Campaign Manager which handles
          companies' ad accounts. I worked on a front-end feature that allows a company to associate their company with an ad account when going through the new campaign creation
          flow. In the second half of the summer, I worked on the API and front-end component for the Company Creation feature in which a user can create a company page on the fly. The new Company Creation
          design featured inline efforts to mitigate the attrition of transitioning to a new window.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft | Explorer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2017 - Redmond, WA</h3>

          <p>In the Microsoft Explorer internship, I had the opportunity to
          "explore" both the Program Manager position and the Software Developer
          role. I really enjoyed the creative aspect of being a PM and the
          problem-solving challenge of being a dev.</p>

          <p>I worked on a team producing Microsoft Sway which is kind of like Powerpoint, but the application does all of the designing and templating for you. Two other interns and I worked on improving the discoverability of the navigation feature (to jump through Sway slides more easily). We iterated through designs as PMs that we later implemented as engineers in C# and Typescript. Check out our pull-down navigation bar!</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2016 | Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>I was created an inventory system for the lab using Google Spreadsheet's Script Editor to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and
          learned that Google has some neat built-in functions. I also worked with the GrovePi to mess around with proof-of-concept Internet of Things projects. I <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/IoT/tree/master/GrovePi" target="_blank">
          coded</a> a function that posted tweets when a button was
          pressed on the GrovePi. I also was able to livestreame all
          the current tweets in the world and make a light sensor flash when a specific hashtag
          appeared. For a better visual, watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/KWlcQqoKCoU" target="_blank">
