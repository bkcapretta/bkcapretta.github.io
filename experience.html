          <h2 class="section-heading">Spotify | Backend Engineer</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2019 to Current - Boston, MA</h3>
          
          <p>After using Spotify for the first time in 2016 to listen to Hamilton's soundtrack, it immediately became 
            my dream to work there. Everything I did in college was in pursuit to help my chances of landing that Spotify
            internship... Fast forward four years and I feel like I have the coolest job in the world.</p>
          
          <p>Currently as a full-time Backend Engineer at Spotify, I am working on implementing the data-facing 
            backend service for the <b>2020 Wrapped Campaign</b> (your top songs, artists, genres, etc). Prior to embedding on this team, I worked on a squad focused around playlist curation for any mood or activity. I road managed a test, implemented playlist strategies, and helped migrate radio and playlist frameworks to new experimentation platforms and upgrade our pipelines. As an intern, I fleshed out a hack week project to production-ready code, in which we tested, <b>On Repeat & Repeat Rewind</b> (mixes that would show you the music you can't stop listening to). This test led to an increase in Spotify overall consumption, which is no simple feat. </p>
            
          <p>
            Outside of the work day to day, I lead the Boston office as a <b>Women@ ERG Co-Lead</b> and help coordinate weekly social presentations for co-workers to share their passions (from topics like Frisbee and A cappella to Emotional Robots and Poetry).
          </p>
          
          <p></p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Fall 2018 & Spring 2019 - Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>I served as a Project Manager in <a href=“https://www.facebook.com/JumboCode/”>JumboCode</a>,
          which is a Tufts student-run club dedicated to making websites and applications
          for non-profits while empowering students to work on out-of-school projects.
          I led a project to make a website for the <b><a href="https://www.textbookexchangenetwork.com/">Textbook Exchange
          Network</a> (TEN)</b>, a coalition of student-run textbook exchanges on Boston university campuses where students can browse, buy, and sell used books every semester. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">LinkedIn | Software Engineer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2018 - San Francisco, CA</h3>

          <p>Intering within LinkedIn Marketing Solutions (LMS), I focused on its Campaign Manager which handles
          companies' ad accounts. I worked on a front-end feature that allows a company to associate their company with an ad account when going through the new campaign creation
          flow. In the second half of the summer, I worked on the API and front-end component for the Company Creation feature in which a user can create a company page on the fly. The new Company Creation
          design featured inline efforts to mitigate the attrition of transitioning to a new window.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft | Explorer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2017 - Redmond, WA</h3>

          <p>In the Microsoft Explorer internship, I had the opportunity to
          "explore" both the Program Manager position and the Software Developer
          role. I really enjoyed the creative aspect of being a PM and the
          problem-solving challenge of being a dev.</p>

          <p>I worked on a team producing Microsoft Sway which is kind of like Powerpoint, but the application does all of the designing and templating for you. Two other interns and I worked on improving the discoverability of the navigation feature (to jump through Sway slides more easily). We iterated through designs as PMs that we later implemented as engineers in C# and Typescript. Check out our pull-down navigation bar!</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2016 | Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>I was created an inventory system for the lab using Google Spreadsheet's Script Editor to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and
          learned that Google has some neat built-in functions. I also worked with the GrovePi to mess around with proof-of-concept Internet of Things projects. I <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/IoT/tree/master/GrovePi" target="_blank">
          coded</a> a function that posted tweets when a button was
          pressed on the GrovePi. I also was able to livestreame all
          the current tweets in the world and make a light sensor flash when a specific hashtag
          appeared. For a better visual, watch my <a href="https://youtu.be/KWlcQqoKCoU" target="_blank">
