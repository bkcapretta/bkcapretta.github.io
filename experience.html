          <h2 class="section-heading">JumboCode | Project Manager</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Fall 2018 & Spring 2019 - Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>Over the past year I served as a Project Manager in <a href=“https://www.facebook.com/JumboCode/”>JumboCode</a>,
          which is a student-run club dedicated to making websites and applications
          for non-profits while empowering students to work on out-of-school projects.
          I specifically led the project to make a website for the <a href="https://youtu.be/fk-BdViAczU">Textbook Exchange
          Network</a> (TEN). TEN is a coalition of student-run textbook exchanges
          on Tufts University campus where students can browse, buy, and sell
          used books every semester. </p>

          <p>Found in 2016, TEN originally created their own version using
          Google Forms and Google Spreadsheets, but their implementation wasn’t
          secure nor scalable enough, especially if they wanted to expand to other college.
          This past year my JumboCode group of eight developers and
          two designers took on the challenge to make a secure and scalable website
          and database to manage the buying and selling of books. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/TENPoster.png" alt="">

          <p>Filling this leadership position forced me to consider every part of
          the project from ground-up, like constructing a project plan,
          making a design doc, reflecting weekly on failures and successes, running hallway
          usability testing, running UI/UX testing, considering defects and vulnerabilities,
          and more.</p>

          <h4>Difficulties</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Taking a big picture problem and breaking it down into individual tasks</li>
              <li>Losing a designer and three developers in the Fall; onboarding a new designer and two developers in the Spring</li>
              <li>Not knowing how to construct our data schema, and then constantly updating it</li>
              <li>Learning new technologies (I thought we could all learn new technologies together
                  but it would've been way more advantageous had I been knowledgebale of the tech stack I chose from the beginning)</li>
              <li>Communication and getting the team to do work outside of meetings</li>
             </ul>

          <h4>Successes and Takeaways</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Planning before coding goes a long long way</li>
              <li>Every team member learned a new technology!</li>
              <li>Our front-end team fully implemented two different sets of designs</li>
              <li>Despite some hiccups, people finally understood how to use Git,
                  make pull requests, and review each others' code </li>
              <li>Momentum grew over the course of the year as our group remained invested and excited about the project</li>
            </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">LinkedIn | Software Engineer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2018 - San Francisco, CA</h3>

          <p>This past summer I worked under LinkedIn Marketing Solutions (LMS),
          specifically on its Campaign Manager which handles
          ad accounts for companies. My first project for the summer focused on associating
          one's company with the ad account when going through the new campaign creation
          flow. With the API already finished, I jumped in by writing a design document
          and implemented the front-end. </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/linkedin.png" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/cm-basecamp.jpg" alt="">

          <p>The second part of the summer focused on company creation. A user had to
          associate a company page in the campaign creation flow, but if they
          had no existing company page, they needed to create one on the spot.
          The current version redirected users to a new window to create this
          company page; however, it was found that 20% fewer users finished the campaign
          creation flow when having to create a company page. The new company creation
          design is inline in efforts to mitigate the attrition. With this feature open
          to start, I implemented the API and designed the front-end.</p>

          <p>Some key takeaways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ember.js and Play</li>
              <li>Git (again) and Atom</li>
              <li>The layers of an API and how it works</li>
              <li>More comprehensive testing: integration, acceptance, and unit tests</li>
              <li>Over-communication</li>
              <li>Acting like an owner</li>
            </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft | Explorer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2017 - Redmond, WA</h3>

          <p>I interned in the Explorer Program which gave me the opportunity to
          "explore" both the Program Manager position and the Software Developer
          role. I really enjoyed the creative aspect of being a PM and the
          problem-solving challenge of being a dev.</p>

          <p>I worked on a team called Microsoft Sway which is part of the Office
          Suite. After picking a template and inputting desired text/pictures,
          Sway does all the design and layout for the user, creating a beautiful
          presentation or document immediately.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/msbuilding.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/msteam.jpg" alt="">

          <p>I was grouped with two other interns and we were tasked with improving
          the discoverability of the navigation feature (also known as the Table of
          Contents). If someone wanted to get through a long Sway, it was our job
          to make the Table of Contents easier to see and use. The first four weeks
          were spent as Program Managers designing to make the navigation
          feature more discoverable. This time included a lot of talking to designers,
          presenting ideas, adjusting to fit what the users wanted, etc. The last
          eight weeks were spent developing the project in Typescript and C#.</p>

          <p>We implemented the functionality for the pull-down button at the top
          of the left photo and the Table of Contents bar at the top of the screen
          on the right photo.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/sway2.png" alt="">

          <p>A brief list of some things I learned:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typescript and C#</li>
              <li>Git and Visual Studio</li>
              <li>How to work in someone else's large codebase</li>
              <li>Flighting - code that collects telemetry when a button is triggered</li>
              <li>CSS for animation and so much more</li>
              <li>Accessibility and how to address those concerns in code</li>
              <li>Working in a group of three people</li>
            </ul>

          <h3 class="subheading">Spring/Fall 2017 - Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>For the entirety of 2017, I was a lab leader for multiple computer
          laboratories each week for intermediate programming students in Data Structures.
          After meeting with other lab leaders once a week, I graded homework and
          provided individual assistance with class homework and projects during
          office hours.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Center for Engineering Education and Outreach | Software Engineer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2016 | Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>Two summers ago I worked at the <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu/" target="_blank">
          Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a>
          (CEEO) where I learned about:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Arduinos</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pis</li>
            <li>GrovePi (<a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/" target="_blank">Dexter Industries</a>)</li>
            <li>Wifi and Bluetooth</li>
            <li>Internet of Things</li>
            <li>If-This-Then-That model</li>
            <li>Javacript and Python</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For my first project of the summer, I was tasked with making an inventory
          system for the lab. I used Google Spreadsheet's powerful tool, the Script
          Editor, to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and
          learned that Google has some neat built-in functions.</p>

          <p>Here is a look at the interface. See more about it
          <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Inventory-System" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>

          <center><img class="img-fluid" src="img/inventory.png" alt=""></center>

          <p>Later on in the summer, I worked with the GrovePi (while my partner
          worked with the EV3) and the idea of the Internet of Things. The purpose
          was to take physical inputs to produce virtual outputs with the devices,
          and vice versa. One example I created posted tweets when a button was
          pressed on the GrovePi. Another small project I worked livestreamed all
          the current tweets and a light sensor would flash when a specific hashtag
          appeared. </p>
