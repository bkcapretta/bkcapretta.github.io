          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2018: San Francisco, CA</h3>

          <p>This summer I am working on LinkedIn's Marketing Solutions team, 
          specifically on the Campaign Manager which handles
          ads for companies. My project for the summer will focus on 
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/ad/accounts/choose?campaignType=sponsoredStatusUpdate">
          quick company associations</a> when creating a company ad, building
          both the API and frontend in both Ember.js and Play.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Data Structures Teaching Assistant</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Spring/Fall 2017: Medford, MA</h3>

          <p>For the entirety of 2017, I was a lab leader for multiple computer 
          laboratories each week for intermediate programming students in Data Structures.
          After meeting with other lab leaders once a week, I graded homework and
          provided individual assistance with class homework and projects during 
          office hours</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Microsoft Explorer Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2017: Redmond, WA</h3>

          <p>I interned in the Explorer Program which gave me the opportunity to
          "explore" both the Program Manager position and the Software Developer
          role. Surprising myself at the end of the summer, I ended up enjoying 
          the dev position way more.</p>

          <p>I worked on a team called Microsoft Sway which is part of the Office
          Suite. I like to initially compare it to Powerpoint, but it truly differs
          in many ways. After picking a template, Sway does all the design and 
          layout for the user, creating a beautiful presentation or document 
          immediately.</p>

          <p>I was grouped with two other interns and we were tasked with improving
          the discoverability of the navigation feature (also known as the Table of
          Contents). If someone wanted to get through a long Sway, it was our job
          to make the Table of Contents easier to see and use. The first four weeks
          were spent as Program Managers designing how we would make the navigation
          feature more discoverable. This time included a lot of talking to designers,
          presenting ideas, adjusting to fit what the users wanted, etc. The last
          eight weeks were spent as developers programming the project in Typescript and C#.</p>

          <p>We implemented the functionality for the pull-down button at the top
          of the left photo and the Table of Contents bar at the top of the screen
          on the right photo.</p>

          <p>A brief list of some things I learned:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typescript and C#</li>
              <li>Git and Visual Studio</li>
              <li>How to work in someone else's large codebase</li>
              <li>Flighting - code that collects telemetry when a button is triggered</li>
              <li>CSS for animation and so much more</li>
              <li>Accessibility and how to address those concerns in code</li>
              <li>Working in a group of three people</li>
            </ul>
          
        <!--  <p>Some cool things that happened this summer include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Connecting with Tufts alumni who work at Microsoft</li>
              <li>Seeing the CEO Satya Nadella speak more than once</li>
              <li>Participating in a study for the Word team to help design a new feature</li>
              <li>Meeting and then personally given baked cookies from the CVP of OneNote</li>
            </ul> -->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Center for Engineering Education and Outreach Intern</h2>
          <h3 class="subheading">Summer 2016: Medford, MA</h3>
          
          <p>Two summers ago I worked at the <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu/">
          Center for Engineering Education and Outreach</a> 
          (CEEO) where I learned about:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Arduinos</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pis</li>
            <li>GrovePi (<a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/">Dexter Industries</a>)</li>
            <li>Wifi and Bluetooth</li>
            <li>Internet of Things</li>
            <li>If-This-Then-That model</li>
            <li>Javacript and Python</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>For my first project of the summer, I was tasked with making an inventory 
          system for the lab. I used Google Spreadsheet's powerful tool, the Script 
          Editor, to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and 
          learned that Google has some neat built-in functions.</p>

          <p>Here is a look at the interface. See more about it 
          <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Inventory-System">on Github</a>.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/inventory.png" alt="">

          <p>Later on in the summer, I worked with the GrovePi (while my partner 
          worked with the EV3) and the idea of the Internet of Things. The purpose
          was to take physical inputs to produce virtual outputs with the devices,
          and vice versa. One example I created posted tweets when a button was 
          pressed on the GrovePi. Another small project I worked livestreamed all 
          the current tweets and a light sensor would flash when a specific hashtag
          appeared. </p>
