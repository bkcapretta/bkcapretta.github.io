		<h2>School 2017 Projects</h2>
		<p>This past Spring semester, I took two computer science classes where 
		I learned way more than I expected to learn. In my first class listed below, all
		projects were completed with a partner. In the second class, all projects
		were completed independetly except for the final group project.</p>

		<p><b>Projects in Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming</b>
		<ul>
			<li><u>Files, Pictures, and Interfaces</u>: reported the average brightness of 
			an image file, and implemented <i>readaline</i> that reports similarities 
			in file data</li>
			
			<li><u>Interfaces, Implementations, and Images</u>: implemented a two-dimensional,
			polymorphic, unboxed array using Hanson's C <i>interfaces and implementations</i>, 
			and to then used that implementation to identify Sudoku solutions</li>
			
			<li><u>Cache and Locality</u>: implemented blocked two-dimensional arrays, and then
			used it to evaluate the performance of image rotation using three different 
			array-access patterns with different locality properties</li>
			
			<li><u>Integer and Logical Operations</u>: given a PPM image, compressed 
			the image by transforming color spaces and discarding info using lossy
			<a href="cs_projects/arith.pdf">compression</a>. There was a lot of 
			packing and unpacking of binary data, work with two's complement, and
			floating-point arithmetic.

			<p>Here's a funny picture of what the compressed image looked like half-way 
			through the project:</p>

		    </div><br>
			
			<li><u>Analysis of AMD64 Assembly Code</u>: read, analyzed, and understood
			a half-dozen or so C procedures given access only to an executable binary. 
			In the process of doing so, learned how to use two debuggers (GDB and DDD)</li>
			
			<li><u>A Universal Virtual Machine</u>: wrote a software <a href="cs_projects/um.pdf">
			implementation</a> of a simple virtual machine</li>
			
			<li><u>Code Improvement Through Profiling</u>: used profiling tools
			(like kcachegrind) to improve the performance of the universal machine emulator</li>
			
			<li><u>Assembly-Language Programming</u>: implemented a calculator that used
			Reverse Polish Notation in assembly language</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>*Due to school policy, I'm unable to share this work*</p>
		
		<p><b>Projects in Web Programming</b>
		<ul>
			<li><u>The Black Car Service</u> (Client Side): used Google Maps' API 
			to <a href="https://github.com/bkcapretta/comp20-bcapretta/tree/master/notuber">
			retrieve neighbors' coordinates</a> and display their locations on a map</li>
			<li><u>The Black Car Service</u> (Server Side): created get and post requests
			to enter and keep track of passengers and vehicles</li>
			<li><u>Security Vulnerability</u>: identified three 
			<a href="cs_projects/security/security.html">security issues</a>
			with another student's Black Car Service project, including but not
			limited to cross-site scripting, lack of rate limiting, and out-of-bounds
			input.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Summer 2016 Projects</h2>

		<p>Last summer I worked at the <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu/">Center for Engineering 
			Education and Outreach</a> (CEEO) where I learned about:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Arduinos</li>
			<li>Raspberry Pis</li>
			<li>GrovePi (<a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/">Dexter 
			Industries</a>)</li>
			<li>Wifi and Bluetooth</li>
			<li>Internet of Things</li>
			<li>If-This-Then-That model</li>
			<li>Javacript and Python</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>For my first project of the summer, I was tasked with making an inventory 
		system for the lab. I used Google Spreadsheet's powerful tool, the Script 
		Editor, to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and 
		learned that Google has some neat built-in functions.</p>

		<p>Here is a look at the interface. See more about it 
		<a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Inventory-System">on Github</a>.</p>

		<p>Later on in the summer, I worked with the GrovePi (while my partner 
		worked with the EV3) and the idea of the Internet of Things. The purpose
		was to take physical inputs to produce virtual outputs with the devices,
		and vice versa. One example I created posted tweets when a button was 
		pressed on the GrovePi. Another small project I worked livestreamed all 
		the current tweets and a light sensor would flash when a specific hashtag
		appeared. </p>

		<p>For a better visual, watch my youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/KWlcQqoKCoU">
		video</a>. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/IoT/tree/master/GrovePi">
		code</a> on Github. Here's me presenting on the GrovePi!</p>

		<h2>School 2016 Projects</h2>

		<p>In my data structures and intro to CS class, I have put my skills 
		to good use. Here are some assignments from the past year where I've 
		really put my knowledge to task: </p>

		<ul>	
			<li>A search engine that indexes and searches a file tree for strings, similar to how 
			the Mac Spotlight feature works! <a href="cs_projects/proj2.pdf">Grep - It's Like grep
			But Something is Off</a></li>
			
			<li>A simulation of Amazon's order processing functions through fetching and retrieval
			"units". <a href="cs_projects/proj1.htm"> Nozama Online</a> helped 
			me to understand queues.</li>

			<li>A project on "brute force" and cracking codes encrypted with a transposition cipher.
			<a href="cs_projects/intro_proj2.pdf">Encryption and Lists.</a></li>

			<li>A <a href="cs_projects/intro_proj1.pdf">Pacman</a> game that 
			introduced the idea of objects through classes.</li>	
		</ul>
