		<h2>Summer Projects</h2>

		<p>This past summer I worked at the <a href="http://ceeo.tufts.edu/">CEEO</a>
		   where I learned about:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Arduinos</li>
			<li>Raspberry Pis</li>
			<li>GrovePi (<a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/">Dexter 
			Industries</a>)</li>
			<li>Wifi and Bluetooth</li>
			<li>Internet of Things</li>
			<li>If-This-Then-That model</li>
			<li>Javacript and Python</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>For my first project of the summer, I was tasked with making an inventory 
		system for the lab. I used Google Spreadsheet's powerful tool, the Script 
		Editor, to create this project. I learned Javacript while creating it and 
		learned that Google has some neat built-in functions.</p>

		<p>Here is a look at the interface. See more about it <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/Inventory-System">here</a>
			on Github.</p>

		<p>Later on in the summer, I worked with the GrovePi (while my partner 
		worked with the EV3) and the idea of the Internet of Things. The purpose
		was to take physical inputs to produce virtual outputs with the devices,
		and vice versa. One example I created posted tweets when a button was 
		pressed on the GrovePi. Another small project I worked livestreamed all 
		the current tweets and a light sensor would flash when a specific hashtag
		appeared. </p>

		<p>For a better visual, watch my youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/KWlcQqoKCoU">
		video</a>. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/tuftsceeo/IoT/tree/master/GrovePi">
		code</a> on Github. Here's me presenting on the GrovePi!</p>

		<h2>School Projects</h2>

		<p>In my data structures and intro to CS classes, I have put my skills 
		to good use. Here are some assignments from the past year where I've 
		really put my knowledge to task: </p>

		<ul>	
			<li>A search engine that indexes and searches a file tree for strings, similar to how 
			the Mac Spotlight feature works! <a href="cs_projects/proj2.pdf">Grep - It's Like grep
			But Something is Off</a></li>
			
			<li>A simulation of Amazon's order processing functions through fetching and retrieval
			"units". <a href="cs_projects/proj1.htm"> Nozama Online</a> helped 
			me to understand queues.</li>

			<li>A project on "brute force" and cracking codes encrypted with a transposition cipher.
			<a href="cs_projects/intro_proj2.pdf">Encryption and Lists.</a></li>

			<li>A <a href="cs_projects/intro_proj1.pdf">Pacman</a> game that 
			introduced the idea of objects through classes.</li>	
		</ul>

		<h2>This website!</h2>
	
		<p>I am learning a TON just as I make this website. I am excited to learn more soon! See my 
		<a href="https://github.com/bkcapretta/bkcapretta.github.io">progress</a>
		if you care to check it out!</p>

		<p>Through this past year, I have learned how important it is to plan before
		diving into writing the code.
		My professor Mark Sheldon wrote something pretty helpful 
		<a href="cs_projects/project_planning.pdf">here</a>.</p>
