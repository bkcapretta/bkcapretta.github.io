		<h2 tag="film">Film</h2>
	
		<p>During the spring of 2015 as a senior, my high school gave us six weeks to do whatever
		we wanted, so I decided to take on a film internship in San
		Francisco at <a href="http://fridaysfilms.com/">Friday's Films</a>.</p>

		<p>In the six weeks there, I learned the film-making process from the initial
		creative development stage to the post-production stage. I worked hands-on
		with different cameras and lighting equipment. I also learned how to use
		editing software programs like Final Cut Pro. With the footage I filmed
		with the other two interns, I produced a few videos by the end of the
		internship.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The first video I created was intended to remind people in the
			office how to properly use the kitchen. 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip082ocRYSo">Snack Etiquette.</a></li>
			
			<li>The second video I filmed and edited focused on cleaning up in 
			the office. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdW-1fZuQ5s">Work
			 Etiquette.</a></li>
			
			<li>Finally, here is a video I edited of me rambling on about how much I love music and 
			everything I've done with it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjeiFkSUNbg&t">

		<h2 id="w1b">Warm 1 Body</h2>

		<p>For four years in high school, I was the president of a project called
		<i>Warm 1 Body</i>. A certified 501(c)(3) non-pofit organization founded
		in 2010, <i>Warm 1 Body</i> provided caps, gloves, and socks annually 
		for the homeless in Richmond, Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco, and
		Marin County during the winter season. Each year I wrote a letter to 
		family and friends to raise money, and since its first year in 2010, 
		<i>Warm 1 Body</i> raised over $23,000 to warm around 2,100 people at $8
		per set. After gathering all the materials, I contacted shelters to hand
		out the clothing myself.</p>

		<p>The feet, hands, and head are the most vital body parts to keep warm,
		so while I passed out what felt like a small bag with caps, gloves, and 
		socks, this gift truly made a difference in peoples' daily lives. Working
		on <i>Warm 1 Body</i> was most exciting for me because of the direct and
		real impact that I experienced. Nothing beats someone beaming a huge smile your 
		way and knowing you made at least a little difference.</p>

		<p>I created a website through Wix.com to show a bit more of my processes
		and updates throughout the duration of this project.(*NOTE* This website
		was created before learning any CS skills)
